### Hi, I'm Ivy Benson!

## Software Engineer learning with Thinkful

I am working a software engineering student from Minneapolis, MN. I am passionate about the creativity in the field!

I am looking to collaborate on full-stack projects including social media desgin!

I am in the process of mastering HTML 5, CSS 3, jQuery, and React. I am learning how to build servers on the backend with Node and Express. I love the process of integrative testing with Postman, Mocha, and Chai.

I am also on the lookout for someone to help me learn Groovy and Python, I've seen some amazing projects with those programs and I am excited to learn them.
