        <h2>Hi, I'm Ivy!</h2>
        <p>I am a full stack web developer from Minneapolis, MN.</p>

        <!-- I went with a bulkier introduction to get in the groove of adding my own text -->

        <p>
          I originally went to school for Theatre Tech & Design as well as
          Business Administration. Turns out, that's hard to make a living with
          that degree. I am looking to apply my skills in web development
          instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web development is something that I've been interested in exploring
          for quite a while. I like to be able to apply creative problem solving
          which is a large factor in both web development and theatre. And I'm
          going to count putting my work out online as basically a performance.

        <h2><a name="about"></a>About Me:</h2>
        <p>
          I am loving my time at Thinkful. I put in the hours and learn
          something new everyday <i>and</i> I get to apply that new knowledge
          right away. The web development field is all about learning something
          new. I get competitive about making the best that I can. I will always
          be challenging myself to create the design the best content out there.
          I want to be a part of one of the most passionate communities I've
          ever met.
        </p>

          <li>
            I am new to web development and have been having a lot of fun doing
            it. I have recently been learning about algorithms and data
            structures which is intensely fascinating. I have recently jumped
            into the world of React which really thrills me because of how
            adaptable it is. When finished with the program I would like to
            offer services including:
            <ul>
              <li>Write programs with a variety of computer languages.</li>
              <li>
                Test programs for errors and fix the faulty lines of computer
                code.
              </li>
              <li>Update and streamline existing programs and apps.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            While I love to work both independently and in a team, I stick by
            the phrase 'Teamwork makes the dream work' and look forward to
            collaborating with others on projects.

              Find yourself longing for entertainment and the regular socials
              and Netflix just aren't cutting it? Bust your boredom with this
              app! Within the app you can entertain yourself four different
              ways. You can find a new joke, test yourself with trivia, find a
              new cocktail recipe, and find an activity to do. I used HTML, CSS,
              Javascript, and jQuery to build this app. Here is the

            <p>
              Dungeons Truth is an app that role playing game players can use to
              create a more rounded out experience when playing the game.
              Dungeons Truth acts as a platform to log the players and
              characters experiences throughout the campaign. Upon log in users
              create a campaign that displays a code. Once the code is created
              all players can add themselves into the game on the same campaign
              code log their journey together. Users log minimal player
              information. On campaign log users can post publicly and privately
              taking down towns they have traveled to, who they meet, what
              creatures they fight, and magical objects they pick. This app uses
              React for the front end and my own NodeJS server for the backend.

            <p>
              HabitNow is a tool that users can use to build habits. There is no
              limit to the number of goals that they can add, each with an
              individual calendar. Users add a habit with the number of times
              per week they want to complete the habit and note about it. The
              habit is then added to the user's dashboard. Users track days by
              tapping the calendar of the day they have completed their habit.
              This is what establishes the routine of the habit. This app uses
              React for the front end and my own NodeJS server for the backend.
