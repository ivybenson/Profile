        <h2> Hi, I'm Ivy! </h2>
        <p> I am a web developer from Minneapolis, MN. </p>
          
          <!-- I went with a bulkier introduction to get in the groove of adding my own text -->
          
        <p> I originally went to school for Theatre Tech & Design as well as Business Administration. Turns out, that's hard to make a living with that degree. I am looking to apply my skills in web development instead. </p>
        <p> Web development is something that I've been interested in exploring for quite a while. I like to be able to apply creative problem solving which is a large factor in both web development and theatre. And I'm going to count putting my work out online as basically a performance. </p>

        <h2> About Me: </h2>
           <p> I am loving my time at Thinkful. I put in the hours and learn something new everyday <i>and</i> I get to apply that new knowledge right away. The web development field is all about learning something new. I get competitive about making the best that I can. I will always be challenging myself to create the design the best content out there. I want to be a part of one of the most passionate communities I've ever met. </p>
        <ul> 
          <li>I am new to web development and have been having a lot of fun doing it. I have started on the basics of Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</li>
          <li>While I love to work both independently and in a team, I stick by the phrase 'Teamwork makes the dream work' and look forward to collaborating with others on projects.</li>
          <li>In 2020 I've been challenging myself to make more homemade food and have mastered some truly tasty recipes including but not limited to:
            <ul>
              <li>Fried Rice with Tofu</li>
              <li>Buffalo Cauliflower with Mac&Cheese</li>
              <li>Vegetarian Sushi Bowls</li>
            </ul> </li>
          <li>I have a new found love for Animal Crossing since I did not grow up with it.</li>
