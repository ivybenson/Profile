        <h2> This is my first webpage - here is more about me! </h2>
        <p> My name is Ivy and I am from Minneapolis, MN. <p/>
        <p> I originally went to school for Theatre Tech & Design as well as Business Administration. Turns out, that's hard to make a living with that degree. I am looking to apply my skills in web development instead. </p>
        <p> Web development is something that I've been interested in exploring for quite a while. I like to be able to apply creative problem solving which is a large factor in both web development and theatre. And I'm going to count putting my work out online as basically a performance. </p>
