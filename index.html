        <h2>Hi, I'm Ivy!</h2>
        <p>I am a full stack web developer from Minneapolis, MN.</p>

        <!-- I went with a bulkier introduction to get in the groove of adding my own text -->

        <p>
          I originally went to school for Theatre Tech & Design as well as
          Business Administration. While I do love theatre, I found that I was
          looking for a field with more growth and flexibility for the future. I
          am looking to apply my skills in web development instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web development is something that I've been interested in exploring
          for quite a while. I like to be able to apply creative problem solving
          which is a large factor in both web development and theatre. And I'm
          going to count putting my work out online as a performance.

        <h2><a id="about"></a>About Me:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I have loved my time at Thinkful. I put in the hours and learn
            something new every day, <i>and</i> I get to apply that new
            knowledge right away. The web development field is all about
            learning something new. I get competitive about making the best that
            I can. I will always be challenging myself to create the design the
            best content out there. I want to be a part of one of the most
            passionate communities I've ever met.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am new to web development and have been having a lot of fun doing
            it. I have recently been learning about algorithms and data
            structures, which is fascinating. I have recently jumped into the
            world of React, which thrills me because of how adaptable it is.
            When finished with the program, I would like to offer services
            including:
            <ul>
              <li>Write programs in a variety of coding languages.</li>
              <li>
                Test websites and applications for errors and fix faulty lines
                of computer code.
              </li>
              <li>Update and streamline existing websites and applications.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            While I love to work both independently and in a team, I stick by
            the phrase 'Teamwork makes the dream work' and look forward to
            collaborating with others on projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Outside of coding, I love to cook! Over the last year, I challenged
            myself to cook something new every week. Some of my favorites
            include buffalo roasted cauliflower, vegetarian sushi bowls, and an
            incredible potato leek soup. I find that cooking is a great way to
            relax and challenge my creativity.

              Find yourself longing for entertainment, and the regular socials
              and Netflix just aren't cutting it? Bust your boredom with this
              app! Within the app, you can entertain yourself in four different
              ways. You can find a new joke, test yourself with trivia, find a
              new cocktail recipe, and find an activity to do. I used HTML, CSS,
              Javascript, and jQuery to build this app. Here is the

            <p>
              Dungeons Truth is an app that role-playing game players can use to
              create a more rounded out experience when playing the game.
              Dungeons Truth acts as a platform to log the player’s and
              character’s experiences throughout the campaign. Upon login, users
              create a campaign that displays a code. On the campaign log, users
              can post publicly and privately logging towns they have traveled
              to, who they meet, what creatures they fight, and magical objects
              they pick find. This app uses React for the front end and my own
              NodeJS server for the backend. Here is the

            <p>
              HabitNow is a tool that users can use to build habits. There is no
              limit to the number of goals they can add, each with an individual
              calendar. Users add a practice with the number of times per week
              they want to complete the habit and note about it. Next, the habit
              goes to the user's dashboard. Users track days by tapping the
              calendar of the day they have completed their task. This action is
              what establishes the routine of the habit. This app uses React for
              the front end and a NodeJS server for the backend. Here is the
